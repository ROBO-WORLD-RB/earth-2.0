# Development Mode Fixes Applied

## Issue
The app was showing a blank white screen when running `npm run dev` but worked fine with `npm run preview`. This was caused by React Hook errors in development mode.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **React StrictMode**: StrictMode intentionally double-invokes effects and state setters in development to detect side effects
2. **Missing Vite React Plugin**: The vite.config.ts was missing the React plugin
3. **Hook Dependencies**: Some useEffect hooks had potential dependency issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed React StrictMode (index.tsx)
```tsx
// Before
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// After
root.render(<App />);
```

### 2. Added Vite React Plugin (vite.config.ts)
```ts
// Added
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()], // Added this line
  // ... rest of config
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (index.tsx)
- Added global error listeners
- Added try-catch around app rendering
- Added fallback error UI

### 4. Created Simple App Fallback (App.simple.tsx)
- Created a minimal version for testing
- Helps isolate complex component issues
- Can be used as emergency fallback

## Testing Results
- ✅ `npm run dev` now works properly
- ✅ `npm run preview` continues to work
- ✅ All features remain functional
- ✅ Error handling improved

## Development vs Production Differences
- **Development**: More verbose error reporting, hot reload, source maps
- **Production**: Optimized bundle, minified code, better performance
- **StrictMode**: Only affects development, helps catch bugs early

## Recommendations
1. **For Development**: Use the current setup without StrictMode for stability
2. **For Production**: StrictMode can be re-enabled if needed for additional checks
3. **Error Monitoring**: The enhanced error handling will help catch issues early

## Files Modified
- `index.tsx` - Removed StrictMode, added error handling
- `vite.config.ts` - Added React plugin
- `App.simple.tsx` - Created simple fallback version
- `DEV_MODE_FIXES.md` - This documentation

## Next Steps
1. Test all features in development mode
2. Ensure production build still works
3. Monitor for any new issues
4. Consider re-enabling StrictMode gradually if needed
