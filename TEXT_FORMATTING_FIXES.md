# Text Formatting Fixes - Addressing Layout Issues

## Issues Identified from User Feedback

Based on the screenshot provided, several formatting issues were identified:

### 1. **Text Justification Problem**
- **Issue**: Text was appearing with awkward spacing due to full justification
- **Fix**: Changed to left-alignment (`text-left`) for natural reading flow
- **Impact**: More comfortable reading experience

### 2. **Container Width Issues**
- **Issue**: Text container was too wide, making it hard to track lines
- **Fix**: Reduced max-width from `max-w-4xl lg:max-w-5xl` to `max-w-3xl`
- **Reasoning**: Optimal reading width is 60-80 characters per line

### 3. **Inconsistent Paragraph Spacing**
- **Issue**: Uneven spacing between paragraphs
- **Fix**: Standardized paragraph spacing to `mb-5` with consistent `leading-[1.8]`
- **Result**: More uniform and professional appearance

### 4. **List Item Spacing**
- **Issue**: List items had too much vertical spacing
- **Fix**: Reduced list spacing from `space-y-3` to `space-y-2` and `mb-2` to `mb-1`
- **Result**: Better visual grouping of related items

### 5. **Message Container Spacing**
- **Issue**: Too much space between messages
- **Fix**: Reduced message spacing from `mb-8` to `mb-6`
- **Result**: Better conversation flow

## Technical Changes Made

### Container Styling:
```tsx
// Before
max-w-4xl lg:max-w-5xl

// After  
max-w-3xl (for AI responses)
max-w-2xl (for user messages)
```

### Text Alignment:
```tsx
// Added explicit left alignment
text-left
```

### Paragraph Spacing:
```tsx
// Before
mb-6 last:mb-2 leading-[1.8]

// After
mb-5 last:mb-2 leading-[1.8] text-left
```

### List Formatting:
```tsx
// Before
space-y-3, mb-2

// After
space-y-2, mb-1, text-left
```
